For this assignment you are asked to complete the following tasks:
	a) Test drive the application and run all test cases for the methods of the Calculator class (valid and invalid code)
	b) Create unit tests for a new method called Divider(divident,divisor)--run them to fail
	c) Implement the code for the method Divider(divident, divisor) in the Calculator.cs class
	d) Run them with data to pass the tests
	e) Run them using divide-by-zero data to fail the tests
	f) Make sure you handle the case of dividing by zero in the code and run again to pass all tests
	g) Create unit tests for a new method called ToThePower(base,exponent)--run them to fail
	h) Implement the code for the method ToThePower(base,exponent) in the Calculator.cs class
	i) Run them with data to pass the tests 
	j) Inject some incorrect data to fail the tests
	k) Make necessary corrections in the code and run again to pass all tests
